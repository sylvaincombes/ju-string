## Why another lib

I know there are already a gazillion of open source javascript libraries out there, so why another one again ?

Because I want these :
 
- decoupled in small components
- simple, limited to what I found useful (purely subjective)
- standalone when possible
- usable in browsers and nodejs
- choice of my own naming, knowledge of internals ...

And I wanted to play and learn with some toys too like build system, testing, ci, npm ...


## How to start

### In browser

1. In your html page include the javascript :
    
    	<script type="text/javascript" src="../build/ju/string.min.js"></script>
    
    
2. You're ready, start using with for example :
	
    	ju.string.trim('   my value    ');
    	
    	
### In nodejs

1. Install with npm
		
		npm install ju-string

2. Use it in your code

		var s = require('ju-string');
		s.trim('   my value    ');
